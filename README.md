# Classifying rock paper scissors images with pytorch

The dataset contains images of hand gestures from the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
The dataset was split to 1458 training examples and 730 test examples.
My model's test set accuracy is 99.17%.

The data was downloaded from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors)

I used transfer learning (MobileNet) for my model.
